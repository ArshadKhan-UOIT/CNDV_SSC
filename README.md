Improving IT service delivery to federal departments

Analyze the life cycle of incident tickets that Shared Services Canada receives to better understand the impact on our partner departments' experience. Our objective is to be able to identify tickets that are bounced between support groups or remain open for long periods of time to inform process improvements.

We created a dashboard on Power BI to investigate the data, and present our findings in graphs.
